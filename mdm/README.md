# MDM reference package

Status: `REFERENCE_VALIDATED`, LAB-only, and not approved for production.

This directory contains versioned, non-secret MDM source records, schemas,
traceability data, operational procedures, and deterministic Relution 26.1.1
LAB outputs for Apple, Windows, and Android.

It does not contain a production tenant inventory, assignments, credentials,
certificates, decrypted exports, device results, or production approval.

## Evidence boundary

The package distinguishes these states:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `OBSERVED` | Directly inspected in this checkout or an approved source |
| `DOCUMENTED` | Stated by a cited primary source |
| `MEASURED` | Produced by a deterministic command or controlled test |
| `INFERRED` | Reasoned from evidence but not directly established |
| `PROPOSED` | Target design that requires approval and environment validation |
| `REFERENCE_VALIDATED` | Source shape or value checked against the repository reference data |
| `NOT_EVIDENCED` | Required tenant, device, or operational evidence was not supplied |

`NOT_EVIDENCED` does not mean absent, compliant, non-compliant, or zero.
Reference validation does not prove device application or operational safety.

## Current package

- 23 policy source records
- 17 active LAB policy records
- 17 rulesets
- 17 Relution workspaces
- 68 checksummed output files
- 5 required environment placeholders
- Relution reference version 26.1.1
- syntax and reference-schema validation recorded as true
- Lab round trip, device application, rollback, and production approval
  recorded as false

The private source manifest covers 133 PDF records. Those PDFs are not tracked.
`mdm verify-sources` requires the approved local corpus under
`private/source-pdfs-cache/`. A public clone can validate source contracts and
checked-in outputs but cannot re-hash absent PDFs.

## Commands

Build the Node.js CLI first:

```sh
pnpm build:node
```

Public-clone checks:

```sh
pnpm rexp:built mdm validate
pnpm rexp:built mdm diff
pnpm rexp:built mdm manifest
```

Private source verification:

```sh
pnpm rexp:built mdm verify-sources
```

Rebuild LAB outputs:

```sh
pnpm rexp:built mdm generate
```

When `RELUTION_REXP_KEY` is set, encrypted archives are written only to the
ignored `private/mdm-archives/LAB/` directory. Randomized encrypted archive
hashes are excluded from the deterministic manifest.

## Data handling

Keep tenant inventories, exports, credentials, certificates, source PDFs, and
environment values under approved private storage. The repository ignores the
`private/` lane. Promote only reviewed, sanitized findings and hashes.

Do not assign these LAB policies to production devices. Production use requires
installed-version validation, controlled import and export, representative
device tests, rollback evidence, owner approval, and explicit assignment
review.
